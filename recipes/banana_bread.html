        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>

            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>

            <li>2 ⅓ cups mashed overripe bananas</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat brown sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a separate large bowl until smooth. Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.</li>    
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 60 minutes. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
